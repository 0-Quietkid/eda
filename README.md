# EDA on Visa stocks
 
This is an exploratory data analysis, on the Visa stock prices where I have used the dataset from kaggle to do statistical analysis and data analysis to find the price trend in stock price trends over the years using jupyter notebook and my main library for this project was pandas. To visualise the data I have used matplotlib.
